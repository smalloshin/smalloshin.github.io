This is my University of Washington website, where I host everything about my role as a professor, and more. It's hosted on the University of Washington faculty web servers at https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko.

Do you wish there was something I'd add to it, or have you found a bug? Please submit an issue!

Are you interested in adapting this for your own site? Go for it! The `CC0` license implies a few things:

-   I view the code as public domain. Do what you like with it.
-   The site isn't written for reuse, so I recommend forking.
-   I'm not in a position to provide a ton of support for adapting it, but I'm happy to answer the occasional question.

Crediting me by name and linking to this repo is appreciated, but not required.
