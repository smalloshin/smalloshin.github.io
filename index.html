                <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    As the urbanization of the human population continues, the importance of 
                    intelligent transportation systems has grown significantly. The use of sophisticated 
                    computational methods, such as deep learning and computer vision, can enhance 
                    the development of efficient solutions to tackle challenges in the transportation 
                    industry. In this paper, we demonstrates the construction of an efficient pipeline for 
                    measuring the intersection turning volume, one of the well-known task in
                    the transportation field. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Intersection turning volume refers to the number of vehicles that are turning 
                    left or right at an intersection during a specific period of time. Such volume is useful
                    for transportation planners to not only understand overall performance of an 
                    intersection but also determine the design of turn lanes or signal timing plans for improving safety 
                    and reducing congestion. A conventional approach to measure the turning traffic volumes relys on manual
                    efforts to count the number of vehicles in situ or from videos. This approach may
                    have some concerns in terms of being labor-intensive, prone to sampling bias
                    , and unsuitable for those applications that need dynamic data collection
                    like adapative light control. Fig 1. allows readers to experience counting 
                    the number of vehicles for each type of turns by counting manually. Readers may find
                    this task is time-consuming and hard to scale up for intelligent transportation systems.

                    This paper discusses an efficient and automated approach for measuring turning 
                    volumes at intersections based on computer vision technique. Fig. 1 gives
                    the system overview of this approach. The main components are: 1) traffic monitoring cameras: 
                    obtaining videos of the intersection with clear view; 2) object 
                    detection algorithm: detecting the location of an object and identify which type of 
                    vehicle the detected object is; and identify objects in the video footage; 3) object tracking
                    algorithm: associating the objects detected by the object detection algoithm across multiple
                    frames to generate a movement trajectory of each vehicle; 4) intersection turning volume
                    computation: identify the lanes where the starting point and the end point of 
                    a trajectory are located to compute the intersection turning volume. The rest of this paper
                    will describe the detail of each component.

                <h2>II. Object Detection Algorithm</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step in extracting traffic flow information from the video is to locate the cars, which is
                    where object detection algorithms come into play. Object detection is the task of identifying the
                    location of objects in an image and classifying them into different categories. The task can be
                    divided into two sub-tasks: object localization and object classification. While human beings can
                    easily identify objects in an image, we can refer to the process of how humans identify objects to
                    better understand object detection:

                        background by identifying its outline.</li>
                    <li id="hobd_2">Once we have identified the object's outline, we then extract its features and try
                        to match them with known patterns to determine what the object is.</li>
                    <li id="hobd_3">
                        After we have matched the object's features with known patterns, we can classify the object
                        based on its features.

                    <li id="hobd_4">
                        However, sometimes we may perceive illusions or misidentify objects. To account for this, we
                        apply multiple checks to determine the likelihood of an object's existence in a particular area,
                        and we use our prior experiences to filter out low-confidence objects.

                <p>
                    In this project, we use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection algorithm as our detector to
                    identify the position of cars and classify them. YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm that
                    is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a deep learning model that simulates the
                    way humans think about an image. Like the human brain, YOLO first separates the objects from the
                    background by identifying their outlines, and then it extracts their features to match them with
                    known patterns to determine what the object is. By applying multiple checks and prior experiences,
                    YOLO filters out low-confidence objects and accurately identifies the positions of cars in the
                    video.

                <ol>
                    <li class="inline-math" id="yolop_1">When given an image, YOLO takes each pixel's RGB color as input
                        to its Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Each color (e.g. red represented as $(255, 0,
                        0)$) is converted to a numerical value.</li>
                    <li id="yolop_2">
                        The first step of the CNN process is similar to the first step (<a href="#hobd_1">hobd_1</a>)
                        for a human identifying an object. YOLO applies a series of filters to the image to enhance the
                        object's outline. This means that YOLO is extracting "outline" features of the object.
                    </li>
                    <li id="yolop_3">
                        YOLO's CNN applies multiple filter layers to the image. Each filter layer extracts more complex
                        features from the previous layer. Eventually, the final output of the CNN is a feature map that
                        represents the probability of objects of different classes being present in the image. This can
                        be thought of as a combination of steps two and three (<a href="#hobd_2">hobd_2</a> and <a
                            href="#hobd_3">hobd_3</a>) in human object detection. With this, YOLO can both locate and
                        classify objects.
                    </li>
                    <li id="yolop_4">
                        After identifying the position and class of an object, YOLO generates a Bounding Box (bbox)
                        around the object. The bbox includes YOLO's confidence score, which indicates the likelihood
                        that an object is present within the bbox. YOLO can then filter out low confidence objects by
                        setting a threshold for confidence. This is similar to the fourth step (<a
                            href="#hobd_4">hobd_4</a>) in human object detection, where humans may ignore certain areas
                        based on experience and probability.

                    1. Component Introduction:
                    A component can let user to annotate out the car in the image.
                    We will time how long it takes for user to finish the annotation,
                    and compare it with YOLO's time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. User's Experience:
                    User will know what YOLO's job is by doing simple annotation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. How to use?:
                    Press the start button to start the annotation. Then, user can
                    draw a bbox around the car, select the car's class on the right
                    side, and so on.
                    When user finish the annotation, press the finish button to
                    submit the result.
                </p>

                    User will it is not easy to do YOLO's job. An it is labor-intensive
                    and time-consuming job, so they will discover the importance of
                    let YOLO do the job for human.

                <h3>Convolutional Neural Network</h3> (ai)
                <p>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the core of every object detection algorithm. It is a type of
                    deep learning model that can be trained to extract an object's features from an image. However, CNN
                    does not actually see an image. Instead, it only sees a series of numbers. These numbers represent
                    the RGB values of every pixel in the image (as shown in YOLO process step <a
                        href="#yolop_1">one</a>). By transforming the image into a series of numbers, the task of image
                    detection can be solved mathematically, and computers can perform the task for us.</p>
                <p>To understand how CNN works, we can compare it to the neural structure in the human brain. Each layer
                    of CNN is composed of neurons that work in parallel, with neurons connected between layers. The
                    connections between neurons apply functions such as multiplication and addition. After the
                    computations, the output results are generated, such as bounding box position and object class.
                    Below, you can try changing the input pixel colors to see how the output of CNN changes. This
                    particular CNN is trained to identify the patterns of "T" or "L".</p>

                    A component can let user know how CNN work. User can change
                    the input pixel color to see how the output of CNN change.

                    2. User's Experience:
                    User will know how the pixel color will affect the output of
                    CNN. They will simply know what CNN is.

                    3. How to use?:
                    Select the color on the color palette, and click the pixel
                    you want to change the color. Then, the output of CNN will
                    change to L or T in real time.

                    4. What user will learn?:
                    User will know although CNN in most of the time is accurate,
                    but it is not perfect. In the process they will learn sometimes
                    CNN will make mistake if the input with noise.

                <h3>Feature Extraction</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    CNNs perform a series of complex calculations on the input image to extract meaningful features. One
                    of the primary operations performed by CNNs is matrix convolution, which involves sliding a filter
                    matrix over the input matrix and computing the element-wise product of the filter and input
                    matrices, followed by summing up the results. For example, given an input matrix:
                </p>
                <p class="inline-math">
                    $$
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 2 & 3 \\
                    4 & 5 & 6 \\
                    7 & 8 & 9 \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    and a filter matrix:
                </p>
                <p class="inline-math">
                    $$
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 2 \\
                    3 & 4 \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    we can perform matrix convolution to obtain the output matrix:
                </p>
                <p class="inline-math">
                    $$
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    37 & 47 \\
                    67 & 77 \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this example, the output element in the first row and first column (i.e., 37) is obtained by
                    computing the element-wise product of the input matrix and the filter matrix, as shown below:
                </p>
                <p class="inline-math">
                    $$
                    \begin{bmatrix}

                    4 & 5\\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \ast
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 2\\
                    3 & 4\\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    (1\times1)+(2\times3) & (1\times2)+(2\times4)\\
                    (4\times1)+(5\times3) & (4\times2)+(5\times4)\\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    37 & 47 \\
                    67 & 77 \\
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    Performing matrix convolution multiple times with different filters helps the CNN extract different
                    features from the input image. These features are then passed to the subsequent layers of the
                    network for further processing and analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Convolution plays a crucial role in object detection with CNN. When CNN needs to extract feature
                    information of objects from an image, it can scan the image with a filter matrix to enhance the area
                    containing the object while obscuring other areas. For instance, to extract the upper and lower
                    bounds of a square from an image, a filter matrix can be used to scan the image. The example below
                    demonstrates this process:
                    $$
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                    27 & 15 & 9 & 4 & 5 & 7 & 3 & 8 & 24 & 19 \\
                    5 & 27 & 19 & 11 & 8 & 29 & 25 & 11 & 29 & 2 \\

                    This process of object detection using CNNs is similar to the <a href="#hobd_2">second</a> and <a
                        href="#hobd_3">third</a> steps a human would take to identify an object. In YOLO, CNNs use this
                    technique to both locate and classify objects. To better understand the impact of feature extraction
                    on object detection, we have prepared a real image below to demonstrate the process of feature
                    extraction. We have used four different filters from a real DeepSORT trained model's first layer.
                    You can choose which filter to apply using the slider, allowing you to see the image before and
                    after the filter is applied. This interactive demonstration will help you gain insight into how
                    feature extraction affects object detection. Try dragging the slider and selecting a filter from the
                    dropdown menu to see the difference:

                    User will discover the convolution operation can extract
                    the feature from image, but the result may not always
                    extracted the feature usable for indentifying object.

                <h3>IOU Confidence and Label Prediction</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    In the previous section, we learned how to extract low-level features, such as object edges, from an
                    image. In this section, we will explore higher-level features that can provide more information
                    about the object, such as its type and the probability of it being present in the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike the edge features from the previous section, these higher-level features can be easier to
                    understand when visualizing them. They detect patterns in the image and provide useful information
                    about the object. In this section, we will show four different feature maps that highlight different
                    patterns of the object. You can use these feature maps to guess the object's position by drawing a
                    bounding box on a canvas. We will then tell you the IoU (Intersection over Union) of your bounding
                    box and the object's true position bounding box. The IoU is a metric that measures the ratio of
                    overlap between two bounding boxes. The higher the IoU, the more overlap between the two bounding
                    boxes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In general, an IoU score above 0.5 is considered a good match. The IoU score is calculated using the
                    following formula:
                    $$IoU = \frac{Area\ of\ Overlap}{Area\ of\ Union}$$
                    Although the formula looks simple, it can be difficult to visualize. The following figure
                    illustrates the calculation of IoU to help you better understand it:
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, let's try to identify the object's type and location from the feature maps shown below. We will
                    provide you with the IoU score of your identified location and type, and let you know if your
                    identification is correct:

                    Hint: The feature map on the top left corner may indicate the probability of a scooter, while the
                    feature maps on the top right and bottom left corners may indicate the probability of a car. The
                    feature map on the bottom right corner may indicate the probability of a large vehicle.

                    1. Component Introduction:
                    A component can let user try to identified the object
                    position and label the object from feature maps. User
                    will see 4 feature maps from YOLO, and they will learn
                    where the object is and what the object is from feature
                    maps through the process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. User's Experience:
                    User will know how YOLO identify the object with the image
                    that is be doing convolution operation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    3. How to use?:
                    User will draw the bbox on the blank canva, and we will
                    calculate the IOU between user's bbox and real object.
                    User will also try to label the object from feature maps
                    they see, and we will tell user right or wrong.
                </p>

                <p>
                    4. What user will learn?:
                    They will learn what information contained in feature
                    maps, and how YOLO identify the object with those
                    feature maps. And know it's need training to get the
                    right label and bbox.
                </p>


                <h3>Filtering False Positives with Confidence Threshold</h3> (not ai)
                <p>
                    Now that we have learned how YOLO predicts the position and label of objects in an image,
                    let's take a closer look at the results it produces. However, YOLO is prone to producing
                    false positives, which are bounding boxes that do not actually contain an object. To
                    address this issue, we can filter out false positives by setting a confidence threshold
                    for the predicted bounding boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    YOLO calculates a confidence score for each bounding box it predicts, based on the IoU
                    metric we learned about earlier. We can set a minimum threshold for the confidence score,
                    and discard any bounding boxes with scores below this threshold. By doing so, we can improve
                    the accuracy of the object detection results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the interactive element below, you can adjust the confidence threshold and see how it
                    affects the predicted bounding boxes. Try dragging the scroll bar to adjust the threshold
                    and observe how the false positives are filtered out as the threshold increases.

                    threshold of confidence because it might too high to filter in the
                    right bbox or too low to filter out the wrong bbox.

                <h2>III. DeepSORT Tracking Algorithm</h2> (not ai)
                <p>
                    In the previous section, we discussed how to detect objects in a video frame using YOLO Object
                    Detection. However, to obtain useful data for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), we need to
                    track the detected objects and obtain information on their flow. To achieve this, we can concatenate
                    bounding boxes from different frames, and this process is known as tracking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this section, we introduce the DeepSORT algorithm, which combines deep learning with traditional
                    techniques for tracking. This algorithm achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness in complex
                    scenarios. DeepSORT is an improvement on the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm, a
                    traditional tracking algorithm that can't handle occlusion. Occlusion refers to situations where an
                    object is covered by other objects, causing track fragmentation or track loss. DeepSORT addresses
                    this issue by using a deep learning model to score the similarity between the object in the current
                    frame and the object in the previous frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DeepSORT employs three core techniques:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kalman Filter:</strong> an algorithm used in SORT to predict the object's position in
                        the next frame. Kalman Filter estimates the object's position by using the object's position and
                        velocity in the current frame.</li>
                    <li><strong>Appearance Feature:</strong> the key idea of DeepSORT. It uses a deep learning model
                        called ReID (short for "re-identification") to score the object's similarity based on appearance
                        features. The ReID model is trained to classify an object's appearance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hungarian Algorithm:</strong> an algorithm used to match objects in the current frame
                        with objects in the previous frame when it is challenging to match them using scores from Kalman
                        Filter and ReID model.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help you understand how DeepSORT works, we have provided an interactive element where you can
                    identify the right objects from six objects in each round. The target object is shown on the left,
                    and six objects to be identified are shown on the right. Check the checkbox of the correct object
                    and click the "Submit" button to submit your answer. If you check the wrong object, the checkbox
                    will turn red, and the correct object will turn green. Let's try it out:

                    1. Component Introduction:
                    A component can let user try to filter out the low confidence bbox.
                    User can adjust the threshold of confidence, and the number of bbox
                    will change in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. User's Experience:
                    User will know it is important to set the threshold of confidence,
                    and how to set the threshold of confidence according to the result
                    YOLO give.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. How to use?:
                    User can adjust the threshold of confidence by the scroll bar, and
                    the number of bbox will change in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. What user will learn?:
                    They will learn how to set the threshold of confidence according to
                    the result YOLO give. And know that it is hard to set a perfect
                    threshold of confidence because it might too high to filter in the
                    right bbox or too low to filter out the wrong bbox.

                <h3>Kalman Filter</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    All the object tracking algorithms we have discussed so far rely on the Kalman Filter, a state
                    estimator used for predicting future values based on past observations. It can estimate the state of
                    any numerical value, such as the temperature of a room, the position of a car, the velocity of a
                    ball, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In object tracking, the Kalman Filter is used to estimate the position of an object in the next
                    frame. It utilizes the object's current position and velocity to make this estimation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The following interactive element demonstrates how the Kalman Filter works. Click the "Start" button
                    to begin. The canvas displays bounding boxes, where the red bbox represents the target object's
                    bbox, and it also shows the velocity in vector form. The length of the vector represents the
                    object's speed. Draw the estimated bbox of the target object in the canvas. Try it out:

                    1. Component Introduction:
                    The purpose of this component is to help users learn how the Kalman Filter
                    works by drawing the estimated bbox of a moving object. The component
                    will show previous bbox around the object and vectors indicating
                    its speed in previous frame, user need to guess the next bbox of the
                    target object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. User's Experience:
                    They will learn how the Kalman Filter predict the next bbox of the
                    target object by drawing the estimated bbox of target object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. How to use?:
                    User will see bunch of bbox in the canvas, user need to guess the
                    next bbox of the target object by drawing the estimated bbox. The
                    speed of the target object will be shown by the vector. User will
                    see vector start from 2nd frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. What user will learn?:
                    They will learn the way how the Kalman Filter predict the next bbox
                    is similar to the way we predict the next bbox of the target object.

                <h3>Similarity Score</h3> (not ai)
                <p>
                    In contrast to the SORT algorithm, DeepSORT uses a similarity score produced by a deep learning
                    model to determine whether an object in the current frame is the same as an object in the previous
                    frame after position prediction. This is the reason for the "Deep" in the name DeepSORT. The
                    similarity score is a measure of how similar two objects are in appearance.
                </p>

                <h3>Hungarian Algorithm</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    Once the similarity score and position prediction are done, most objects can be successfully
                    associated with high similarity scores and close position predictions. However, there will be some
                    objects left behind, either due to low similarity scores or inaccurate position predictions. In such
                    cases, we need to pair the remaining objects or decide which object should start a new track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To solve this problem, we use the Hungarian Algorithm, which is a method to solve the assignment
                    problem. The assignment problem is to find the best way to assign N workers to N jobs with a cost
                    matrix. We can also view object pairing as an assignment problem, where we need to find the best way
                    to pair all objects in the current frame with objects in the previous frame. The cost matrix is
                    generated using the similarity score and position prediction. If the number of objects in the
                    current frame is different from the previous frame, we need to add dummy objects to make the cost
                    matrix square, representing the new objects or missing objects in the current frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How does the Hungarian Algorithm pair objects using the cost matrix? Three steps need to be
                    followed: row reduction, column reduction, and finding the minimum line that covers all zeros. Row
                    reduction involves reducing the value of each row to the minimum value. Column reduction involves
                    reducing the value of each column to the minimum value. After row or column reduction, we need to
                    find the minimum line that covers all zeros. If the line number is equal to the number of objects in
                    the current frame, then we can pair the objects. If the line number is less than the number of
                    objects in the current frame, we need to perform row or column reduction again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is an example of the Hungarian Algorithm. The cost matrix is 6 x 6, the number of objects in
                    the current frame is 6, and the number of objects in the previous frame is 6. A low value in the
                    cost matrix indicates that two objects are similar and close to each other, whereas a high value
                    means that two objects are different and far away from each other. In the following interactive
                    element, you can try performing the row reduction, column reduction, and finding the minimum line
                    that covers all zeros yourself. Let's try it:

                    1. Component Introduction:
                    The purpose of this component is to let user know how the Hungarian
                    algorithm works by showing the row reduction and column reduction
                    process of the algorithm, and know how DeepSORT pair the objects
                    in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. User's Experience:
                    They will experience the pairing process of the Hungarian algorithm
                    with a few click. Doesn't need to see the code or math formula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. How to use?:
                    Click reduce button to do the row reduction and column reduction,
                    and zeros will be marked on the table. If zeros is enough to
                    pair all the objects, the pairing will be shown on the right
                    side of the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. What user will learn?:
                    They will learn how the Hungarian algorithm works, and know
                    the pairing process is easy to understand, it's not like a
                    black box or some magic, it's just some simple steps to reduce
                    objects be paired.
                </p>


                <h3>Combining YOLO and DeepSORT</h3> (not ai)
                <p>
                    Now that we have covered how YOLO and DeepSORT work, let's see how we can combine them to track
                    objects in videos. YOLO is used to detect objects in each frame of the video and DeepSORT is used to
                    track those objects over time. The final result is a list of tracks, each corresponding to a unique
                    object that was detected and tracked throughout the video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, it is important to note that the results produced by these algorithms are not always
                    correct and have their limitations. In some situations, objects may not be detected or tracked
                    accurately due to various factors such as occlusion, changes in lighting conditions, or objects that
                    visible size is too small because they are far away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the interactive element below, you can see the results of combining YOLO and DeepSORT on a video
                    captured by a camera at different times of the day and weather conditions. The options in the
                    selector allow you to choose between different scenarios. Keep in mind that while the algorithm may
                    perform well in some scenarios, it may not be as accurate in others:

                <h2>IV. From Theory to Real-World Application</h2> (ai)
                <p>
                    In this section, we will explore the practical steps involved in applying the YOLO-DeepSORT
                    algorithm to real-world applications. While the theoretical understanding is important, it is
                    equally crucial to know how to prepare data, train the model, and classify the tracks in real-world
                    scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key factors that determines the performance of a deep learning algorithm is the quality
                    and relevance of the data it is trained on. Although pre-trained models on public datasets are
                    suitable in many cases, if the real-world data has unique characteristics that are not found in the
                    public datasets, the model may not perform well. Therefore, we need to annotate and train the model
                    using our own dataset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first step in applying the algorithm to real-world scenarios is annotation, where we label
                    objects in our dataset and create bounding boxes around them. This annotated dataset is then used to
                    train the model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the quality of the model also depends on several other factors, such as the number of data
                    samples, the model architecture, and the training parameters. Therefore, we need to tune the model
                    by conducting experiments to find the optimal settings that yield the best results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once we have a well-trained model, we can use it to track objects in real-world videos. In
                    Intelligent Transportation Systems, it is essential to know the type of vehicle being tracked.
                    Therefore, we need to classify the tracks based on the object's characteristics, such as its shape,
                    size, and color. This step enables us to obtain additional insights and make more informed decisions
                    based on the tracked objects' attributes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the following section, we will provide a detailed guide on how to perform annotation, model
                    tuning, and track classification to apply the YOLO-DeepSORT algorithm to real-world scenarios
                    effectively.
                </p>

                <h3>Annotation: Creating a High-Quality Dataset</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    In order to train a high-quality model, it is essential to have a high-quality dataset. This means
                    that the process of annotation, or marking up the dataset with labels and bounding boxes, is a
                    critical step. In this section, you can practice annotating objects using a simple version of a
                    professional annotation tool. By doing so, you can get a sense of how long it takes to annotate
                    objects accurately and the level of precision required to produce a high-quality dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interactive tool below provides all the basic functions you need to annotate objects. You can
                    use
                    your mouse to draw bounding boxes around the objects, select the appropriate labels and object
                    status,
                    and submit your annotations. Keep in mind that annotation is a time-consuming task that requires
                    careful attention to detail. The quality of your annotations will ultimately determine the quality
                    of
                    the model you are able to train:

                <h3>Model Tuning</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    Training a deep learning model requires setting various hyperparameters, such as the learning rate,
                    number of epochs, and batch size. These hyperparameters can greatly impact the performance of the
                    model. In this section, we will discuss the process of tuning these hyperparameters to find the best
                    set for our specific application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One important metric for evaluating the performance of the model during training is the loss
                    function. The loss function measures how well the model is predicting the output for a given input.
                    A good loss function should steadily decrease during training and eventually converge to a low
                    value. However, if the loss is too low, the model may be overfitting to the training data, which
                    will result in poor performance on new, unseen data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To find the best set of hyperparameters, we can experiment with different values and observe the
                    loss graph during training. The following interactive tool allows you to visualize the loss graph of
                    the model when using different hyperparameters. You can select different hyperparameters from the
                    drop-down menu and click the "Start" button to see the corresponding loss graph.

                <h3>Track Classification</h3> (ai)
                <p>
                    Once we have obtained the tracks of the objects, the next step is to turn them into useful
                    information for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In the case of intersections, ITS needs to
                    know the number of cars making left turns, right turns, and going straight. Therefore, we need to
                    classify the tracks into different categories. In this section, we introduce a simple method to
                    classify the tracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simplest and most effective way to classify the tracks is by drawing the in/out detection area
                    of each lane on the intersection. The in/out detection area is a polygonal area, and when a track
                    crosses this area, we can classify it into different categories. However, there is a tricky problem
                    here. The edges of the area are highly sensitive, and even a slight change in the edge can have a
                    significant impact on the track count. Therefore, it is essential to pay attention and draw an
                    accurate in/out detection area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is an interactive tool that allows you to draw the in/out detection area of each lane on the
                    intersection. You can adjust the polygon by dragging the corners, and you can move the whole polygon
                    by dragging the center. The red area indicates the area in which the track will be classified as
                    "out," and the green area indicates the area in which the track will be classified as "in." Changing
                    the area will adjust the track count in real-time on the right side, allowing you to see the effect
                    of the area. Give it a try:

                    We have delved into the basic concepts of Object Tracking, making it easier for you to understand
                    how such an AI algorithm works with the help of an interactive tool. Our aim is to provide you with
                    an overall insight into these black-box-like techniques, so that when you try to implement them in
                    your own project, you will know what to avoid and where to apply them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, we have shared some tricks for better implementing the Object Tracking algorithm in ITS
                    applications, helping you to avoid common mistakes and save time when implementing it. We have
                    covered topics such as how to classify tracks, how to improve the accuracy of the algorithm, and
                    what a good model training process should look like.
