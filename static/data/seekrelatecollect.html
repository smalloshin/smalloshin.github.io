		<p>I have received several requests for some of the data from these two papers:
		
		<ul>
			<li>Ko, A.J., Myers, B.A., Coblenz, M.J., and Aung, H.H. (2006). An Exploratory Study of How Developers Seek, Relate, and Collect Relevant Information during Software Maintenance Tasks. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 32(12), 971-987.</li>
			<li>Ko, A.J., Aung, H., and Myers, B.A. (2005). Eliciting Design Requirements for Maintenance-Oriented IDEs: A Detailed Study of Corrective and Perfective Maintenance Tasks. International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), 126-135.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Because of IRB restrictions, I can't post the raw video from these studies, but I can provide <a href="seekrelatecollect.zip">the anonymized, annotated transcripts of these videos</a>. If you have any questions about this data, please contact me directly and I'm happy to help you interpret it.
