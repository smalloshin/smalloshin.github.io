		<p>Thanks for helping me evaluate Frictionary, a system for automatically extracting and aggregating problems from help requests, bug reports, discussion boards, and any other textual source of software problem discussions.</p>
		
		<p>The idea behind Frictionary is simple:</p>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Gather <b>hundreds of thousands</b> of help requests, bug reports, and other types of discussion board posts about Firefox. This prototype is based of of ~103,000 posts between November 2009 and July 2010, from <a href="http://support.mozilla.org">support.mozilla.org</a>, <a href="http://superuser.com">superuser.com</a>, <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/">Firefox forums on mozillaZine</a>, and <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Mozilla bug reports</a>.		
		</li>
		
		<li>Use natural language processing and information extraction techniques to identify <b>problem topics</b> in each post such as "<b>Firefox crashing</b>" and "<b>bookmark deleting</b>", and the many other examples in the screenshot above.</li>
		<li>Aggregate these topics and present them over time to see trends in users' experiences with Firefox.</li>
		</ol>
				
		<p>Because this is a research prototype, I have a few disclaimers:</p>
	
		<ul>
		<li>The user interface currently eats a lot of RAM to keep much of the data in memory. I apologize if this degrades the experience or compels you to close your favorite tabs :)</li>
		<li>The data is this demo is already more than a year old. When thinking about it's utility, imagine back to the Firefox 3.6 and 4.0 releases in 2009 and 2010.</li>
		<li>I've tested the demo in Chrome 12 and greater, Firefox 4 and greater, and Safari 5.0 and greater.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>how you can help</h1>	

		<p>I'm interested in your <b>critical opinions</b> about Frictionary and its potential value to your work at Mozilla. In particular, there are <b>four topics</b> I'd like your opinion on:
		<ul>
		<li>In browsing the data, did you discover anything you didn't know about Firefox users, Firefox use, or a particular Firefox release?</li>
		<li>If Frictionary had live data from all over the web about Firefox, what role do you think the information would have in your own work, if any? What role might it have in the larger Mozilla community, if any?
		<li>Are there ways you wish you could view or analyze the data that would be more useful to your role at Mozilla?</li>
		<li>Is there information you would find more useful than the topic data presented in Frictionary?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I'm hoping to submit an academic publication about Frictionary on September 23rd, describing the system. With your permission, <b>I may quote you anonymously</b> in the article, to support claims about Frictionary's strengths and weaknesses. 
				
		<p>If you're okay being quoted, <b>pease send answers to the above questions</b> to me at <a href="mailto:ajko@uw.edu">ajko@uw.edu</a> (the more detail, the better).</p>
		
		<p>Thanks again for your help! You can launch Frictionary with the link below:</p>
